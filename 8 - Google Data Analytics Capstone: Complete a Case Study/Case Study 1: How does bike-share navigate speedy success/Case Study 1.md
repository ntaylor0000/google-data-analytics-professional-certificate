## Introduction:

This repository contains all the work completed for the project, which is based on the questions and scenario outlined in the [README.md](README.md). The project follows the Google Data Analytics process, structured around six key steps: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act, as outlined in the course. All solutions, analysis, and deliverables are organized accordingly within this repository.

Note: Throughout the project, I use multiple tools to accomplish the same tasks. While this approach may be inefficient in a real-world scenario, it is intentionally designed to demonstrate the range of skills and tools I’ve acquired during the course.

**Data Analysis Process**
  - Ask: Identify the business task and determine the key stakeholders.
  - Prepare: Collect the data, identify how it’s organized, determine the credibility of the data.
  - Process: Select the tool for data cleaning, check for errors and document the cleaning process.
  - Analyze: Organize and format the data, aggregate the data so that it’s useful, perform calculations and identify trends and relationships.
  - Share: Use design thinking principles and data-driven storytelling approach, present the findings with effective visualization. Ensure the analysis has answered the business task.
  - Act: Share the final conclusion and the recommendations.
