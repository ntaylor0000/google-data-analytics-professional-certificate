## Introduction:

This repository contains all the work completed for the project, which is based on the questions and scenario outlined in the [README.md](README.md). The project follows the Google Data Analytics process, structured around six key steps: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act, as outlined in the course. All solutions, analysis, and deliverables are organized accordingly within this repository.

Note: Throughout the project, I use multiple tools to accomplish the same tasks. While this approach may be inefficient in a real-world scenario, it is intentionally designed to demonstrate the range of skills and tools I’ve acquired during the course.

**Data Analysis Process**
  - Ask: Identify the problem or question to solve.
  - Prepare: Collect and organize the necessary data.
  - Process: Clean and transform the data for analysis.
  - Analyze: Explore the data to find insights and patterns.
  - Share: Present your findings with clear visuals and recommendations.
  - Act: Provide actionable steps based on the analysis.


## Step 1: ASK

**Project Background:**

Cyclistic is a bike-share program based in Chicago, offering over 5,800 bikes at 692 docking stations across the city. In addition to traditional bikes, Cyclistic provides reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making the program more accessible for people with disabilities and those who prefer a different riding experience. Most users choose the standard bikes, though about 8% use the assistive options. While many riders use Cyclistic for leisure, around 30% rely on it for their daily commute. Cyclistic offers flexible pricing with single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. The company wants to shift its focus from casual riders to building up its base of annual members, as they are more profitable.

**Business Problem:**

Cyclistic has had success attracting casual riders, but it’s the annual members that really drive profit. The challenge is that while casual riders are already familiar with the service, they haven’t been as likely to commit to an annual membership. Lily Moreno, the director of marketing, believes converting casual riders into members is key to Cyclistic's future growth. The main question she’s asking is: **How do casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently?** This insight is essential for crafting a marketing strategy that will convince casual riders to switch to annual memberships.

**Goals:**

The first step is to answer the question: **"How do casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently?"** Once that’s clear, the team can dive into two other important questions:
1. Why would casual riders want to buy an annual membership?
2. How can Cyclistic use digital media to convince casual riders to become members?
   
By answering these, the goal is to build a targeted marketing strategy that encourages more casual riders to sign up for annual memberships, helping Cyclistic increase both its revenue and its long-term growth.

**Stakeholders:**

- **Lily Moreno:** Director of Marketing, responsible for guiding the marketing strategy and ensuring it aligns with the company’s goals.
- **Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team:** The team of data analysts tasked with collecting, analyzing, and reporting data to support the marketing strategy.
- **Cyclistic Executive Team:** The decision-makers who will review and approve the recommended marketing strategies based on data insights.
- **Casual Riders and Annual Members:** The two key user groups whose behaviors and preferences will be analyzed to guide the marketing efforts.
