**Project Summary:**

This repository contains all the work completed for the project, which is based on the questions and scenario outlined in the [README.md](README.md) file. The project follows the Google Data Analytics process, structured around six key steps: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act, as outlined in the course. All solutions, analysis, and deliverables are organized accordingly within this repository.
Note: Throughout the project, I use multiple tools to accomplish the same tasks. While this approach may be inefficient in a real-world scenario, it is intentionally designed to demonstrate the range of skills and tools Iâ€™ve acquired during the course.
