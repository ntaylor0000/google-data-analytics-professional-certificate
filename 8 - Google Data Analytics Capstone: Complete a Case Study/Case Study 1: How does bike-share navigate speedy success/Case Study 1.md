## Introduction:

This repository contains all the work completed for the project, which is based on the questions and scenario outlined in the [README.md](README.md). The project follows the Google Data Analytics process, structured around six key steps: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act, as outlined in the course. All solutions, analysis, and deliverables are organized accordingly within this repository.

Note: Throughout the project, I use multiple tools to accomplish the same tasks. While this approach may be inefficient in a real-world scenario, it is intentionally designed to demonstrate the range of skills and tools I’ve acquired during the course.

**Data Analysis Process**
  - Ask: Identify the problem or question to solve.
  - Prepare: Collect and organize the necessary data.
  - Process: Clean and transform the data for analysis.
  - Analyze: Explore the data to find insights and patterns.
  - Share: Present your findings with clear visuals and recommendations.
  - Act: Provide actionable steps based on the analysis.


## Step 1: ASK

**Project Background:**

Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago, offering a fleet of 5,824 bicycles across 692 stations, including special assistive bikes like reclining bikes and hand tricycles. Since its launch in 2016, Cyclistic has grown, attracting both casual riders (single-ride or full-day pass users) and annual members. While casual riders are familiar with the program, the company aims to increase the number of annual memberships, which are more profitable for the business. The marketing team, led by Lily Moreno, is exploring ways to convert casual riders into annual members by analyzing the differences in usage patterns and identifying key marketing strategies.

**Business Problem:**

The director of marketing, Lily Moreno, believes that the future success of Cyclistic depends on increasing the number of annual memberships. While Cyclistic has been successful in attracting casual riders through its flexible pricing plans, annual members are much more profitable. To achieve this, the team must understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. This understanding will allow the marketing team to design targeted strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

**Goals:**

The primary goal of the analysis is to identify key differences between casual riders and annual members. By understanding these differences, the team aims to develop a data-driven marketing strategy that encourages casual riders to convert to annual memberships. This involves analyzing Cyclistic’s historical bike trip data to uncover trends and insights that can inform an effective marketing campaign. The insights must be compelling enough to secure approval from the Cyclistic executive team for the proposed strategies.

**Stakeholders:**

- **Lily Moreno:** Director of Marketing, responsible for guiding the marketing strategy and ensuring it aligns with the company’s goals.
- **Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team:** The team of data analysts tasked with collecting, analyzing, and reporting data to support the marketing strategy.
- **Cyclistic Executive Team:** The decision-makers who will review and approve the recommended marketing strategies based on data insights.
- **Casual Riders and Annual Members:** The two key user groups whose behaviors and preferences will be analyzed to guide the marketing efforts.
