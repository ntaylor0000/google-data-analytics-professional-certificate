## Introduction:

This repository contains all the work completed for the project, which is based on the questions and scenario outlined in the [README.md](README.md). The project follows the Google Data Analytics process, structured around six key steps: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act, as outlined in the course. All solutions, analysis, and deliverables are organized accordingly within this repository.

Note: Throughout the project, I use multiple tools to accomplish the same tasks. While this approach may be inefficient in a real-world scenario, it is intentionally designed to demonstrate the range of skills and tools Iâ€™ve acquired during the course.

**Data Analysis Process**
  - Ask: Identify the problem or question to solve.
  - Prepare: Collect and organize the necessary data.
  - Process: Clean and transform the data for analysis.
  - Analyze: Explore the data to find insights and patterns.
  - Share: Present your findings with clear visuals and recommendations.
  - Act: Provide actionable steps based on the analysis.
